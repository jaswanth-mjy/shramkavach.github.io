# 🔍 Why Your Site Doesn't Appear When You Search "Gig"

## The Problem

When you search **"gig"** on Google, your website **ShramKavach** doesn't show up.

This is **NORMAL** for new websites. Here's why:

## 📚 Understanding How Google Works

### 1. Google Doesn't Know Your Site Exists Yet

**Your site is NEW.** Google has probably never crawled it.

**Think of it this way:**
- Google has indexed **billions** of web pages
- Your site was just published
- Google hasn't discovered it yet

**Solution:** Tell Google about your site using **Google Search Console** (see QUICK-START-SEO.md)

### 2. "Gig" is an EXTREMELY Competitive Keyword

**Reality Check:**

Searching for just **"gig"** shows:
- Gigabit (internet speed)
- Gig.com (jobs platform)
- Fiverr gigs
- Music gigs
- THOUSANDS of established sites

**Your site is competing with:**
- Sites that have existed for 10+ years
- Sites with millions of backlinks
- Billion-dollar companies

**This keyword is virtually impossible to rank for.**

## ✅ What You SHOULD Rank For

## 🆘 Still Confused?

1. Google doesn't know your site exists yet (fix: Google Search Console)
2. "Gig" is too competitive (fix: target "gig worker calculator India" instead)
3. Your site is new (fix: time + backlinks + content)
