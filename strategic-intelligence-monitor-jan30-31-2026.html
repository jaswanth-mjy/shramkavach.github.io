                            The primary driver of the precipitous decline in gold and silver prices was the confirmation of Kevin Warsh as the nominee for the Chair of the Federal Reserve. Unlike the incumbent Jerome Powell, Warsh is perceived as a staunch advocate of "sound money" and a critic of the Federal Reserve's expanded balance sheet.

                            The events of January 30-31, 2026, paint a portrait of a world grappling with transition on multiple fronts. In finance, the Kevin Warsh nomination marks the potential end of the "easy money" era. In Indian politics, the swift ascension of Sunetra Pawar demonstrates the ruthless pragmatism required to maintain coalition stability. Meanwhile, the fragile energy truce in Ukraine serves as a stark reminder that in the theater of war, physical realities often override diplomatic agreements.
